Hi Mridu, Hem,
Thank you for the time spent today about the updates needed to the Project-API to support the new elements in the ai-project.json files, needed by the BLE scenario.

The goal is:
•	To support BLE-based IoT systems in ST AIoT Craft;
•	All 6 get-started projects will be available with both USB and BLE connectivity flavors; concerning BLE, let’s start with the four SensorTile.box PRO-based projects, the other two projects will come later, as we need to complete the porting of the AI_SSM firmware to the other two boards;
•	User defined use cases have to be supported too (custom MLC model, same AI_SSM firmware).

As said, in the json file there will be:
•	A new deployment element dedicated to the BLE deployment, in addition to the already existing serial deployment;
•	A new application element targeting the AI_SSM BLE firmware, in addition to the already existing serial application targeting the AI-Inertial serial firmware;
o	This application will have
	“protocol”: 0  BLE
	"bluestv3_payload" as a new field to allow a client (e.g., gateway) to decode a BlueSTv3 binary payload sent over BLE in advertisement messages (beacon);
            "bluestv3_payload": {
                "device_id": "0xXX",
                "fw_id": "0xYY",
                "payload_id": "0xZZWW",
                "decoding_schema": [
                    {
                        "telemetry": "label_id",
                        "type": "int8"
                    }
                ]
            }

See attached file as an example. I will edit the 4 ai-project.json files in the next days and push them on a branch.

ACTION: The Project-API has to be updated to get this new field. Post is not needed for the time being, as the content is pre-canned and will not change; il will be needed in future when the development flow will tbe ready.

There is a new Jira issue fir this: https://jira.st.com/browse/VESPCI-2776.
Reference to the BlueSTv3 protocol is here:   20220505_BlueSTSDK_v3_v.0.0.1.docx

Thank you,
Davide
