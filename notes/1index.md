## Common-online-platform
meeting date: 5-may-2025
come up with proposal for Common online platform will expose certain services, we have to decide on a set of common-services say A, B, C.
we have to decide on development resources and a plan -> development, testing, release phase.
service example: sigle-sign-on as first use case.
all online tools to be adapted to common online platform.

business architecture should also be thought about, because ppl can ask any common services, and management will need justifications on costs.

E-design suite has some common services, we can use these services as common online platform services. and then resuse these service to prove that common services can be used.
